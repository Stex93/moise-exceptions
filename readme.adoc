= Moise

Moise is an organisational platform for Multi-Agent Systems based on notions like roles, groups, and missions. It enables an MAS to have an explicit specification of its organisation. This specification is to be used both by the agents to reason about their organisation and by an organisation platform that enforces that the agents follow the specification.

Some papers describing Moise are available in the folder https://github.com/jacamo-lang/moise/tree/master/doc/publications[publications].
