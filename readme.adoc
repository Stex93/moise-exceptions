= Moise extended with exception handling

This is an extension of the Moise organizational model and infrastructure
(adopted in JaCaMo) that explicitly encompasses the notion
of exception.

We propose an exception handling mechanism for
organization management in multi-agent systems. This mechanism
relies on abstractions that are seamlessly integrated with organizational
concepts, such as responsibilities, goals and norms.
