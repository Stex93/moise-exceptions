# Moise extended with Exception Handling

This is an extension of the Moise organizational model and infrastructure  
(adopted in JaCaMo) that explicitly encompasses exception handling.

We propose an exception handling mechanism for organization management in multi-agent systems.  
This mechanism relies on abstractions that are seamlessly integrated with organizational  
concepts, such as responsibilities, goals and norms.

Some examples are available in the examples folders.

## Installation (requires Gradle)

    git clone git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/moise-exceptions/code moise-exceptions-code
    cd moise-exceptions-code
    gradlew build


## Running the examples (requires Gradle)

From the root folder of the example, execute the following **Gradle task** (recommended to use the Gradle Wrapper):

    gradlew run

The task automatically downloads all the required dependencies.

Another useful task for cleaning up is:

    gradlew clean
