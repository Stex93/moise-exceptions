= Release Notes for Moise

== Version 0.10

- new artifact: *orgBoard*. It manages all the other artifacts of an organisation. Main operations are (see javadoc for more details):
* createGroup
* createScheme

- new observable property for SchemeBoard:
* `goalArgument(schemeId, goalId, argId, value)`: added only if the argument has a value, usually defined by the operation `setArgumentValue`.

- default type of goals is *performance*
* norms for *performance* goals have `done(Sch,Goal,Ag)` as the _what_,
* while *achievement* goals have `satisfied(Sch,Goal)` as the _what_
- *permissions* are perceived by the agents (with the same arguments as obligations)

- use NPL prohibitions when we don't want to regiment some property (like role cardinality). See normative specification of examples/writePaper/wp-os.xml.
- the group and scheme boards initialization have only the first two parameters (the xml file and the type). The last two boolean parameters were removed and a new operation `debug` added. Parameters for the debug operation are:
* `inspector_gui(on)`: opens the GUI window with the current state of the artifact
* `inspector_gui(off)`: closes

- move to gradle
- move to GitHub

== Version 0.9
